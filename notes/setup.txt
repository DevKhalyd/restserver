First we should init git then upload to github.

If I need to know something about git I should see the docs
How to start with heroku

Heroku docs: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs

Here is how to deploy a heroku app

To lift up the server. We need to add the command start in scripts...
Like: nodee app (or where is the main file)

The command: git push heroku master is not updating on github 
just in heroku servers. If you want to update on GitHub servers just use the command git push

Postman environment variables are importants
